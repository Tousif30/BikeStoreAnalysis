# BikeStoreAnalysis
## Objective
The objective of this project is to conduct data analysis on a bike store dataset. The database was sourced from [online](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-sample-database/) and the data were sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database), however all the entities were not utilised. The tables were created and filled with data according to the ERD. Queries were created to extract insightful information about the business.
